The VM Binary dummynetVM.zip contains the running environment for the network emulator.

Before installation, you will need a machine with at least 3 network interfaces, one to serve as the adminstration port,
the other two as the traffic bridging ports.

Installation steps:

1. Download and install VMware player/workstation on your machine.
2. Download and unpack the dummynetVM.zip into a disk folder.
3. Open the dummynetVM in the VMware player/workstation.
4. The freebsd system will boot up to text login screen.
5. Now login as "root", with password "abc123".

6. There are 3 network interfaces defined on this VM, they are em0, em1, and em2.
7. The em0 interface is the admin interface, the em1 and em2 are the data interfaces for bridging traffic. You will need
to associate the actual network interfaces through the VMware settings to the VM's em0, em1 and em2 ports.

8. The emulator consists of a core server application and a web UI. The web UI is built around apache web server
and is ready when the VM boots up.
9. Before running the emulator core application it has to be configured for the actual data ports in the startup script.
10. After login to the freebsd system, please edit the emulator's startup script using following commands :

SHELL>  cd /root/rudolf-netmap-ipfw/
SHELL>  vim looprun_emulator

Update the two lines:
DEV1=em1
DEV2=em2

with the actual network interfaces. Save the file. Now you can run the script to start the emulator.

SHELL> sh ./looprun_emulator

11. The default admin. IP address of this VM is 192.168.80.221. This may not match the sub-network you are using. You
can change this by editing the /etc/rc.conf file.

12. After the IP address is updated, now you can use a web browser to check out the web UI:

http://<admin ip address>/

This web UI allows you to control the functions of the emulator.
